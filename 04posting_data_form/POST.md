As already mentioned POST is meant for uploading data to the server.
There are many formats in which post data can be pushed to the server. 
The three most important are:
- JSON
- URL Encoded Forms
- multipart

We want to espacially look at JSON and URL Encoded Forms.
Data is posted by either using JavaScript in the frontend (JSON is most common in these cases) or
directly using built in HTML forms.
