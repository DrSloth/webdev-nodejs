JSON is a data format which is used a lot in web development. 
Its name is an acronym which stands for 'JavaScrpit Object Notation' and it is
very similiar to plain javascript objects. It is also very efficient to use in JavaScript.

A JavaScript object like this:
```js
let obj = {a: true, b: 10, c: "hello"};
```

would look like this in json:
```json
{
    "a": true,
    "b": 10,
    "c": "hello"
}
```

with the only notable difference being the field names written with `""`
