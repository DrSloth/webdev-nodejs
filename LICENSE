## Give Credit

Give this software and each contributor credit for
contributing to goods or services that you develop, test,
produce, or provide with the help of this software.

## How to Give Credit

In general, give credit in such a way that others can
freely and readily find a written notice identifying
this software, by name, as a contribution to your goods
or services, as well as each contributor, by name, as a
contributor to this software.  Do not do anything to stop
others from sharing, publishing, or using those credits.

## Conventions

If widespread convention dictates a particular way to
give credit for your kind of goods or services, such as
by end credit for a film, citation for an academic paper,
acknowledgment for a book, or billing for a show, then
follow that convention.  For software provided to users to
run on their own computers, give credit in documentation,
notice files, and any "about" page or screen.  For software
provided as a web service, give credit in `credits.txt`
according to <https://creditstxt.com>.

## Who to Credit

If contributors give their names or the name of this
software along with the software in a conventional way,
such as in software package metadata or on an "about" page
or screen, you may rely on the names they give that way
to be accurate and complete.  If contributors don't give
names that way, but include a link to a homepage for this
software, investigate that homepage for names to credit.
If contributors give neither names to credit nor a link
to a homepage, you do not have to do independent research
to find names to credit.

## Declining Credit

On written request from a contributor, remove their name
from the credits for your goods or services going forward.
On written request from all credited contributors to this
software, do the same for the name of this software.
