A framework is a library or a collection of libraries which strongly influences the way you write your code.
The border between libraries and frameworks is not 100% clear. Generally frameworks are larger and something
"you put your code inside of" rather than "just accessing structures and functions" which you would do with normal libs.
This means there are some frameworks which are very "opinionated" on how you have to write your code.

The framework we are going to have a look at is called express. It is rather unopinionated and minimalist but 
it was, and is, very influential. Frameworks which use a routing architecture similiar to express are often 
called "express-like frameworks".

You can install express via npm using `npm install express` 
When using git you should put all `node_modules` directories into the .gitignore as they can become
quite big very fast.
