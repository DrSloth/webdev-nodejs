NodeJS has a package manager called npm (node package manager). It can be used to install various useful packages.
It should have been installed alongside node if installing from the website, on a Linux distribution
you may need to install it for instance with `sudo apt install npm`.

Using npm it is possible to install libraries which contain reusable code which makes development easier. 
A lot of things don't need to be, and shouldn't be, implemented by hand because libraries already exist
which are more optimised in a lot of cases, of course you also save the time.

There are a lot of libraries which can be installed through npm, we will take a look at some important ones.
