Tech stacks are something that you are often confronted with in the world of web development.
A tech stack consists of multiple pieces of software which handle different parts of an app.

Normally web development is about implementing and designing websites and developing the server
side of an app is called backend development. 

In this course we do both which is called full-stack development, thus we look at all parts of a
tech stack.

Teh most common tech stack is called LAMP which is short for:
Linux: The operating system most servers run in
Apache: A web server which can serve files, is capable of running PHP through cgi and much more.
MariaDB: An open source port of oracles MySQL. An SQL relational database.
PHP: A programming language usable for shell scripting and creating web backends (not recommended)

There are many more tech stacks. The one we will work towards is called MEVN.

MongoDB/MariaDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database which can be used instead of MariaDB.
Express: A popular backend framework for NodeJS.
Vue.js: A frontend framework which makes a lot of use cases way more pain free.
Node.js: A javascript execution engine we use for the backend

The operating system is not mentioned because this stack depends way less on OS functionality,
but it is still hosted on Linux in most cases.

However, first we will take a look at the 'vanilla' technologies. 
Vanilla means not using any frameworks or additional software than is required.
