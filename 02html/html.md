The main component of websites is written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
With HTML you "program" a web browser by describing WHAT has to be shown in a markup.
HTML conceptionally only consists of various elements which may contain more elements as children. 
This means you don't describe where something is positioned in HTML but conceptionally only:
elements: what has to be shown?
parents/children: what contains what?
predecessors/successors: what comes after what?


NOTE: 
Actually the HTML specification is a big superset of every other language (besides WebAssembly)
which Browsers can understand. This means CSS (more on that later) and JavaScript are part of the
HTML specification, this turns HTML into a complete programming language.
