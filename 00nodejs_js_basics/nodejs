Nodejs is a JavaScript execution engine which can be used to execute code on the host machine.
It is based on the Chrome implementation of JavaScript (V8). 
Because of node it became possible to create web apps/websites all in JavaScript which makes it
a lot more powerful as a tool to know. In my opinion JavaScript is the most important language
to know alongside C and using it will get you productive very fast.

Nodejs can be installed at (https://nodejs.org/en/) use your operating systems instructions.
For debian based operating systems i recommend installing from apt.
