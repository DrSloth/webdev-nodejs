AJAX is a programming principle which consists of interacting with a server while also interacting
with a client at the same time. It is an acronym for 'Asynchronous JavaScript and XML'.
As we have seen in the previous lesson upon sending a form the page will load into something else.
With AJAX we can GET or POST data while not leaving the page, this is very important for web apps.
While AJAX contains 'JavaScript' and 'XML' the term is used for the complete idiom, other languages
than js may use AJAX and it is very likely that JSON is more common than XML for AJAX nowadays
